# Data Structures in C++

This repository contains fundamental data structure implementations 
developed in C++ as part of my Software Engineering studies.

## Implemented Structures

### Singly Linked List
- Dynamic memory allocation using pointers
- Insertion at the end of the list
- Traversal and display functionality

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Pointer manipulation
- Dynamic memory management
- Basic algorithmic thinking

## Example Output
10 -> 20 -> 30 -> NULL
