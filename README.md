# Data Structures in C++

This repository contains fundamental data structure implementations 
developed in C++ as part of my Software Engineering studies.

## Implemented Data Structures

### 1. Singly Linked List
- Dynamic memory allocation using pointers
- Insertion at the end of the list
- Traversal and display functionality

### 2. Stack (Array-Based)
- Push, Pop, Peek operations
- Overflow and Underflow handling
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Destructor implementation

### 3. Queue (Array-Based)
- Enqueue and Dequeue operations
- Overflow and Underflow handling
- Basic FIFO logic implementation

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Pointer manipulation
- Dynamic memory management
- Array-based data structure implementation
- Algorithmic thinking
